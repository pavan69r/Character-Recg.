# Character-Recg.
This project is a learning step in understanding of Neural Networks
•	Character recognition in Python employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze and identify characters from images. 
•	This deep learning technique enables accurate and automated recognition of handwritten or printed characters, making it valuable for various applications, including optical character recognition (OCR) and text processing tasks.
